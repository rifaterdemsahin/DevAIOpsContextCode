There are no declarations required for operators; they are built into the language syntax. The following are the different types of operators are includes: 


GitHub Copilot: Sure! In C++, operators are symbols that tell the compiler to perform specific mathematical, logical, or manipulative operations. They are used to process primitive data types. Here are the different types of operators in C++ explained with emojis:

### Arithmetic Operators ➕➖✖️➗
These operators perform basic arithmetic operations:
- `+` (Addition): Adds two operands. Example: `a + b`
- `-` (Subtraction): Subtracts the second operand from the first. Example: `a - b`
- `*` (Multiplication): Multiplies two operands. Example: `a * b`
- `/` (Division): Divides the numerator by the denominator. Example: `a / b`
- `%` (Modulus): Returns the remainder of a division. Example: `a % b`

### Relational Operators 🔄
These operators compare two values:
- `==` (Equal to): Checks if two operands are equal. Example: `a == b`
- `!=` (Not equal to): Checks if two operands are not equal. Example: `a != b`
- `>` (Greater than): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right. Example: `a > b`
- `<` (Less than): Checks if the left operand is less than the right. Example: `a < b`
- `>=` (Greater than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right. Example: `a >= b`
- `<=` (Less than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right. Example: `a <= b`

### Logical Operators 🔍
These operators are used to perform logical operations:
- `&&` (Logical AND): Returns true if both operands are true. Example: `a && b`
- `||` (Logical OR): Returns true if at least one of the operands is true. Example: `a || b`
- `!` (Logical NOT): Reverses the logical state of its operand. Example: `!a`

### Bitwise Operators 🧩
These operators perform bit-level operations:
- `&` (Bitwise AND): Performs AND operation on each bit. Example: `a & b`
- `|` (Bitwise OR): Performs OR operation on each bit. Example: `a | b`
- `^` (Bitwise XOR): Performs XOR operation on each bit. Example: `a ^ b`
- `~` (Bitwise NOT): Inverts all the bits. Example: `~a`
- `<<` (Left shift): Shifts bits to the left. Example: `a << 1`
- `>>` (Right shift): Shifts bits to the right. Example: `a >> 1`

### Assignment Operators 📝
These operators assign values to variables:
- `=` (Assignment): Assigns the right operand to the left operand. Example: `a = b`
- `+=` (Add and assign): Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand. Example: `a += b`
- `-=` (Subtract and assign): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand. Example: `a -= b`
- `*=` (Multiply and assign): Multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand. Example: `a *= b`
- `/=` (Divide and assign): Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand. Example: `a /= b`
- `%=` (Modulus and assign): Takes modulus using two operands and assigns the result to the left operand. Example: `a %= b`

### Increment and Decrement Operators 🔼🔽
These operators increase or decrease the value of a variable by one:
- `++` (Increment): Increases the value by one. Example: `a++` or `++a`
- `--` (Decrement): Decreases the value by one. Example: `a--` or `--a`

### Conditional (Ternary) Operator ❓
This operator evaluates a condition and returns one of two values:
- `? :` (Ternary): Example: `condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false`

### Comma Operator ➖➖
This operator allows two expressions to be evaluated in a single statement:
- `,` (Comma): Example: `a = (b = 3, b + 2)`

### Type Casting Operators 🔄
These operators convert one data type to another:
- `static_cast<type>`: Example: `static_cast<int>(a)`
- `dynamic_cast<type>`: Example: `dynamic_cast<Derived*>(base_ptr)`
- `const_cast<type>`: Example: `const_cast<char*>(str)`
- `reinterpret_cast<type>`: Example: `reinterpret_cast<int*>(ptr)`

These are the primary operators in C++ that you will use to perform various operations on data.

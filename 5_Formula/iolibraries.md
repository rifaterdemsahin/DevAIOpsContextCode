Purpose: The iostream header file defines the standard input and output streams for reading and writing.

Key Components:

std::cin: Standard input stream.

std::cout: Standard output stream.

std::cerr: Standard error output stream (unbuffered).

std::clog: Standard logging stream (buffered).

Usage: It is used for basic input from the keyboard and output to the console. This file must be included whenever you use cin, cout, cerr, or clog in your programs.


GitHub Copilot: Sure! Let's explain it in a simple way:
### What is iostream in C++? 🖥️

Imagine you have a magic box that can talk to you and listen to you. This magic box is called a "computer." 🪄💻

### Key Parts of the Magic Box:

1. **std::cin**: This is like the computer's ears. 👂 It listens to what you type on the keyboard. ⌨️
2. **std::cout**: This is like the computer's mouth. 👄 It talks to you by showing words on the screen. 🖥️
3. **std::cerr**: This is like the computer's emergency alarm. 🚨 It tells you when something goes wrong, right away. ⚠️
4. **std::clog**: This is like the computer's diary. 📔 It writes down important messages, but it takes its time. 🕰️

### How to Use the Magic Box:

To make the computer listen and talk, you need to tell it to use these parts. You do this by including a special file called `iostream` in your program. 📄 This file has all the instructions the computer needs to use its ears, mouth, alarm, and diary.

So, whenever you want to type something to the computer or see something on the screen, you need to include `iostream` in your program. 📝
